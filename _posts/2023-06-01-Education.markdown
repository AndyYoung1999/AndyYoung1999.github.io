## Bachelor of Computer Scinence 
## Shanghai University-----2018.09 - 2022.06

My academic journey commenced at Shanghai University, an institution that only admits the top 10% of students based on the national college entrance examination scores. I pursued a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, a choice that provided me with a clear vision of my future path. I feel fortunate to have gained profound insights into my future, personal growth, and life direction during my undergraduate years. If you wish to delve deeper into my personal journey, you can explore my "ABOUT ME" section.

### School Honors

Throughout my undergraduate journey, I've been fortunate enough to amass numerous accolades, to the extent that at times, I find it challenging to decide where to begin highlighting the most significant ones. First and foremost, on a university-wide level, I was honored as the recipient of the 2019 Outstanding Scholarship, a recognition that necessitated achieving a GPA within the top 1% of the entire student body, along with meeting multiple rigorous criteria. At the time, my GPA stood at an impressive 3.98. Yet, this achievement merely marked the inception of my relentless pursuit of excellence throughout my college tenure.

Culminating my academic journey, I proudly earned the distinction of being a member of the Honors Graduating Class of 2022, an esteemed group comprising fewer than 10 students per cohort. This crowning achievement stands as a testament to my unwavering dedication to academic and personal growth.

### Competition Honors

In addition to the honors at the university level, I also achieved remarkable recognition on a national scale through various competitions. I earned the title of Excellent Award winner in the National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition. Yes, during my junior year, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey and remarkably achieved a balanced financial state within the very first year. This decision underscored my willingness to take risks and my capability to turn ideas into tangible successes.

Furthermore, I proudly secured a First Prize in the National College Student Data Analysis Competition, a highly competitive event that begins at the provincial level, with only the top 1% of teams from each province advancing to the national stage. Ultimately, achieving a place in the top 1% at the national level bestowed me with the honor of a First Prize in this competition.

## Master of Management 
## Tulane University-----2022.09 - 2023.12

Later, I enrolled at Tulane University, where I switched my academic focus to the field of management within the business school. Since my first semester, I encountered numerous inquiries from peers about why I transitioned from computer science to studying business. I made this choice because I possessed a clear understanding of what I truly needed throughout my journey and what my life goals were. I never intended to relinquish my programming expertise; rather, I aimed to leverage my computer science knowledge to its fullest potential.

I comprehended that my proficiency in computer science should ultimately serve the realm of business. Detaching from the tangible world of commerce to solely pursue programming would be impractical. One pivotal aspect of my graduate coursework involved a final project centered around devising an environmental protection plan for Walmart. This entailed exploring various approaches to reduce carbon emissions, including strategies such as minimizing refrigerated transportation and implementing eco-friendly packaging materials.

Among my peers, I was the sole computer science student who possessed the capabilities to employ data analysis techniques to accurately calculate carbon emissions. Brimming with confidence, I meticulously crafted a comprehensive plan, complete with data analysis and predictive modeling, for my presentation. However, my moment of triumph was soon followed by a humbling revelation. The next speaker approached the stage and said, "Isaiah, I deeply admire your proposal and I believe your model is more accurate than anyone's. But I must tell you that your plan would never work in the real world. No American company would willingly undertake environmental initiatives that increase their costs. We can only aim to reduce carbon emissions using existing resources without additional investments."

This unexpected insight left me astounded and prompted me to question the significance of my previous four years of computer science education. In that moment, I recognized the paramount importance of having a strong business sense in professional endeavors. Computer science, I realized, is merely a tool that aids us in achieving our business objectives effectively. From that point forward, I not only embraced my decision to transition to the field of business but also felt grateful for the opportunity to bolster my business acumen with a foundation in computer science.
